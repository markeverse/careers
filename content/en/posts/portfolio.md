Given that we require<cite>[^1]</cite> applicant to also attach their portfolios on top of their CVs, we deemed necessary to provide related resources to help applicants in preparing their materials.

In this regard, we don't want to create many complex instruction and regulations which prevents innovation; hence we just provide the abstract guideline of what we expect and our creative applicants can decide on how to do it. Also, as we believe many other people are smarter than us and already have taken the path that we want to step in, we usually try to adopt the experience of the experts. Consequently, we suggest you to follow the [Prof. Jaakko Lehtinen](https://users.aalto.fi/~lehtinj7/)'s guideline for providing portfolios.

Considering that his guidelines are for academia<cite>[^2]</cite>, the following is slighly <cite>modified[^3]</cite> version of his recommendation to fit with industry jobs:

>In your portfolio, you can include previous work experience, things you've done during internships, and, of course, class and hobby projects alike. The portfolio should include, to the degree possible, pictures, videos (links are fine), or blogs, as well as brief descriptions of **what you did** (specially if team project), **what techniques** you used and what major **challenges you solved**, what **your role was in multi-person** projects, and anything else that's **relevant**. For projects that are not directly visualizable<cite>[^4]</cite>, you can create diagrams of the system you have designed. Ask your artist friends for an example â€“ nothing happens in the art world without portfolios, and challenging technical work is no different in that the count of years of experience, tell only a partial story about your technical talent and creativity.

Note that, the reason we insist on visualization is that, **our team mates must be good at communication**; if you can't use words, use shapes, but communicate your thoughts clearly. 

[^1]: It is in fact *optional*, but we like to spend most of our time on those who have read the job description thoroughly; which we believe is fair and respectful for both parties involved.
[^2]: I highly recommend you to apply for his group if you plan to do graduate studies.
[^3]: Read the original one on Prof. Lehtinen's website [Advice for Students](https://users.aalto.fi/~lehtinj7/adviceforstudents.html).
[^4]: Imagine you managed to solve task delegation conflicts, or optimized daily routine in work due to challenges, etc.
