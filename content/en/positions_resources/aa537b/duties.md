- Build and manage a cross-functional team together with a Product Lead: assist in hiring, provide feedback, set up software development guidelines (code style, best practices). and resolve conflicts during project execution.
- Avoiding the common pitfalls because you have designed, implemented and deployed solutions so many times and built the wrong system enough times to know about common mistakes and pitfalls.
- Be a mentor and train developers in the team to make them better in programming, communication, and planning.
- Provide technical leadership by guiding architectural decisions and mentoring team members to enhance overall competency.
- Assign tasks to team members and offer feedback during task completion.
- Establish and maintain technical standards and best practices to ensure high-quality and maintainable solutions.
- Understand business requirements to come up with solutions and tech specifications for the features.
- Collaborate with cross-functional teams including marketing and design to understand business requirements and translate them into technical solutions.
- Work closely with upper management to align technical efforts with company goals.
- Oversee the full-stack engineering lifecycle, from ideation and design to development, testing, and deployment.
- Contribute to organizational vision by staying updated on industry trends and proposing innovative solutions.
- You will participate in meetings (we know its annoying and most of the time, unproductive, so we keep it under control!), making technical decisions, writing design docs, delegating tasks, reviewing other dev's code/designs, and finally developing.
- You are the de facto leader of the team, and we DO provide you with freedom you need.
